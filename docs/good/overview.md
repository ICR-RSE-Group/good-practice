# 5-Session Coding Good Practices Course
## Reproducible Computational Research Skills for ICR Researchers

---

## **Course Overview**

A practical 5-day course teaching essential coding practices for reproducible research, based on The Turing Way framework. Designed for researchers at all technical levels who use computational methods in their work.

---

## **Who Should Attend**

- **PhD students and postdocs** working with data analysis
- **Principal investigators** managing computational research projects  
- **Research staff** collaborating across computational and clinical teams
- **Anyone** writing code for research who wants to improve their practices

**No prior programming experience required** – the course accommodates mixed technical backgrounds.

---

## **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Create standardized project structures** for reproducible workflows
- **Use version control (Git) effectively** for collaboration and change tracking
- **Write ethical, testable Python code** with bias detection and robust testing
- **Conduct analyses in R** with reproducible reporting and publication-ready visualizations
- **Manage computational environments** using conda and Docker for long-term reproducibility
- **Integrate Python and R workflows** within collaborative research projects
- **Apply The Turing Way principles** for transparent, collaborative, and sustainable research
