### 4. Python Environment (Anaconda/Miniconda) + JupyterLab
**Purpose:** Python programming for Wednesday's session, environment management for Friday, and interactive analysis throughout

**Recommended Installation Option 1: Anaconda (Full Installation)**
- **All platforms:** Download from [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- **Includes:** Python, conda, JupyterLab, and 250+ data science packages

- **Size:** ~400MB download, ~1GB installed
- **Best for:** Users who prefer to install packages as needed

**Installation Steps:**

**For Anaconda:**
1. Download the installer for your operating system
2. **Windows:** Run the installer and check "Add Anaconda to PATH" during installation
3. **Mac/Linux:** Follow the installer prompts, allow it to initialize conda
4. **All platforms:** Choose "Install for all users" if you have admin rights

**For Miniconda:**
1. Download the installer for your operating system
2. **Windows:** Run the installer and check "Add conda to PATH" during installation
3. **Mac/Linux:** Run the installer script and allow it to initialize conda
4. After installation, install JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
   ```

**Installation Notes:**
- ‚úÖ **Windows:** Check "Add Anaconda/Miniconda to PATH" during installation (crucial for command line access)
- ‚úÖ **All platforms:** Allow the installer to initialize conda for your shell
- ‚úÖ **Mac users:** You may need to restart your terminal after installation

**Post-Installation Setup:**
```bash
# Update conda to latest version
conda update conda

# Create your research environment using the step-by-step recipe (see Friday session):
conda create --name biomarker-analysis python=3.9
conda activate biomarker-analysis
conda install pandas=1.5.3 numpy=1.24.3 matplotlib=3.7.1 scikit-learn=1.3.0 jupyter=1.0.0
conda install r-base=4.3.1 r-tidyverse=2.0.0 r-ggplot2=3.4.2 git=2.40.1 pip=23.1.2
pip install umap-learn==0.5.3

# Export your environment for sharing (recommended):
conda env export --no-builds > biomarker-env.yml

# (Optional) Install Docker for containerized reproducibility
# Docker installation will be demonstrated in Friday's session

# Verify JupyterLab installation
jupyter lab --version
```

**Test Installation:**
```bash
# Test conda
conda --version

# Test Python
python --version

# Test JupyterLab (optional - will be covered in Wednesday's session)
jupyter lab --version

## üîê Account Setup and Authentication

### 1. GitLab Access (Primary platform for the course)
**Purpose:** Main version control platform for Tuesday's session

**Setup Steps:**
1. **No account creation needed** - uses institutional SSO
2. **Access the platform:** Navigate to your institutional GitLab URL
3. **Login:** Use your institutional credentials (same as email/network login)
4. **Verify access:** You should see the GitLab dashboard

**Configuration Note:** Detailed GitLab setup, repository creation, and collaboration workflows will be covered in Tuesday's session.

**If you have trouble:**
- Ensure you're connected to the institutional network or VPN
- Contact IT support if SSO authentication fails

### 2. GitHub Access (Institutional account)
**Purpose:** Alternative platform knowledge and broader research community access

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Request access:** Send an email to `schelpdesk@icr.ac.uk` with:
   ```
   Subject: GitHub Enterprise Account Request
   
   Dear ICR Help Desk,
   
   I am participating in the Coding Good Practices course and need access to the institutional GitHub Enterprise account.
   
   My institutional email: [your.email@icr.ac.uk]
   My preferred GitHub username: [desired-username]
   
   Thank you,
   [Your name]
   ```

2. **Wait for invite:** You'll receive an invitation email (usually within 1-2 business days)
3. **Accept invitation:** Follow the link in the email to complete account setup
4. **Verify access:** Log in to the institutional GitHub instance

**Note:** This setup is optional for the core course sessions but recommended for ongoing research collaboration. GitHub workflows and advanced features will be covered in Tuesday's session.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Steps

### 1. Configure Git Identity
**Purpose:** Essential for version control sessions

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
# Set your name (use your real name for research collaboration)
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"

# Set your email (use institutional email)
git config --global user.email "your.email@icr.ac.uk"

# Set default branch name to 'main'
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Configure line ending handling (important for cross-platform collaboration)
# Windows users:
git config --global core.autocrlf true

# Mac/Linux users:
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

**Verify Configuration:**
```bash
git config --global --list
```

**Note:** Advanced Git configuration, SSH key setup, and authentication will be covered in Tuesday's session. This basic identity configuration is sufficient to get started.

### 2. Set Up Authentication Tokens

**Note:** Authentication token setup will be covered in detail during Tuesday's session. The basic configuration below is sufficient for getting started.

#### For GitLab (if needed for command line access):
1. **Log in to GitLab** via SSO
2. **Go to User Settings** ‚Üí Access Tokens
3. **Create Personal Access Token:**
   - Name: "Course Development Token"
   - Expiration: Set to after course completion
   - Scopes: `read_repository`, `write_repository`
4. **Save the token** securely (you won't see it again)

#### For GitHub (after account approval):
1. **Log in to institutional GitHub**
2. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
3. **Generate new token:**
   - Note: "Course Development Token"
   - Expiration: Set to after course completion
   - Scopes: `repo`, `workflow`
4. **Save the token** securely

**Important:** Never share or commit these tokens to repositories! Detailed security practices will be covered in Tuesday's session.

# Test Git
git --version

# Test Python and Conda
python --version
conda --version

# Test R (in R console or RStudio)
# R.version.string

# Create a test directory
mkdir coding-course-test
cd coding-course-test

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Create a test file
echo "# Test Repository" > README.md

# Add and commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test commit"

# Check status
git status

# Clean up
cd ..
rm -rf coding-course-test
```

**Additional Tests (Optional):**

## üìÅ Recommended Folder Structure

Create this folder structure before the course starts:

```
~/research-course/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/          # For your course projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/          # For following along with examples
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/         # For course materials and references
```

**Commands to create:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/research-course/{projects,examples,resources}
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Git and SSH Issues
- **"Permission denied" for SSH**: Check that SSH keys are properly set up and added to services
- **SSH key not working**: Verify public key is correctly copied to GitLab/GitHub/HPC
- **Multiple SSH keys**: Use SSH config file to manage different keys
- **HPC connection issues**: Contact ICR IT support for account access problems

### Python/Conda Issues
- **"conda not found"**: Restart terminal or source your shell profile
- **Permission errors**: Don't use `sudo` with conda, check installation directory permissions
- **Environment conflicts**: Use `conda clean --all` to clear package cache

### VSCode Issues
- **Extensions not installing**: Check internet connection and VS Code marketplace access
- **Terminal not working**: Restart VS Code after installing Git

### Platform Access Issues
- **GitLab SSO fails**: Verify VPN connection and institutional credentials
- **GitHub access denied**: Ensure you've received and accepted the invitation email
