# Wednesday Homework: Session Consolidation (~30 min)

## Practice Tasks

- Create a simple Python function for data loading or analysis (use your own or example data)
- Write a short test to check your function works
- Add a brief README or comments to explain your code
- Spend a few minutes exploring The Turing Wayâ€™s code reuse checklist for ideas on making your code more reusable

## Reflection

- How does organizing your project and using version control help your research?
- What did you find easy or challenging about writing and testing Python code?
- How can you make your code more reusable for others?

*Complete these tasks before the next session to consolidate your skills and prepare for more advanced analysis.*
