# Friday Homework (Researcher Version)

1. Create a conda environment for your own research project using the step-by-step recipe from the session.
2. Export your environment using `conda env export --no-builds` and share the YAML file with a collaborator.
3. (Optional) Try creating a simple Dockerfile for your project and build a container.
4. Read the relevant sections of The Turing Way on reproducible environments and code reuse.
5. List one challenge you faced in making your environment reproducible and how you solved it (or plan to solve it).
